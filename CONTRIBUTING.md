## Developing setup

#### Node

See node installation requirements here (you need node v14.x.x):

#### Linter

To maintain consistent code style we're using [eslint](https://eslint.org/) with [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) config + some tweaks. We have a pre-commit hook that runs the linter but it's better to install plugin for your IDE/text editor to get immediate feedback about code style problems.

#### Editor config

In order to prevent some problems in source files related to different platforms we're using [`.editorconfig` file](https://editorconfig.org/). Please install plugin for your IDE/text editor.
